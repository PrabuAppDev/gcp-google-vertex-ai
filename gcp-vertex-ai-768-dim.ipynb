    "## Multi-Agent Orchestration: Acura MDX Winterization Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver winterization recommendations for the 2022 Acura MDX. It reindexes the owner's manual using 768-dimensional embeddings and orchestrates multiple AI agents to generate actionable outputs using Google Cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier attempts failed due to dimensionality mismatches:\n",
    "> Precondition failed: Query dimensionality (768) does not match database dimensionality (384)\n",
    "\n",
    "This version resolves that by:\n",
    "- Switching to the latest `text-embedding-005` model with 768-dimensional output\n",
    "- Creating a new Vertex AI Matching Engine index and endpoint in `us-central1`\n",
    "- Uploading correctly formatted JSON datapoints with `id`, `embedding`, and `content`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertex AI**: Hosts the vector index and serves queries via Matching Engine\n",
    "- **LlamaIndex**: Handles document chunking, embedding, and interfacing with the vector store\n",
    "- **Crew AI**: Provides multi-agent orchestration with role-based tasks\n",
    "- **Gemini LLMs**: Used for reasoning, summarization, and checklist generation through Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weather Agent**: Adds contextual seasonal hazards for winter\n",
    "- **Manual Review Agent**: Extracts vehicle-specific winterization steps from the owner's manual\n",
    "- **Recommendation Agent**: Compiles a structured winterization checklist in Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation serves as a reusable, extensible template for multi-agent RAG systems grounded in domain documents — integrating LLM reasoning with structured storage and enterprise-ready deployment.\n"

Cold temperatures can reduce battery performance, thicken engine oil, and decrease tire pressure, leading to starting difficulties and reduced fuel efficiency.

      "* **Winter tires:** The manual recommends using winter tires if you live in an area with heavy snowfall. Winter tires have a special tread pattern that provides better grip on snow and ice.\n",
      "* **Tire chains:** The manual also recommends carrying tire chains in case you encounter severe winter conditions.\n",
      "* **Wiper blades:** The manual recommends replacing your wiper blades before winter starts. Worn wiper blades can't effectively clear snow and ice from your windshield.\n",
      "* **Battery:** The manual recommends having your battery checked before winter starts. Cold weather can shorten the life of a battery.\n",
      "* **Antifreeze:** The manual recommends checking your antifreeze level before winter starts. Antifreeze helps prevent your engine from freezing in cold weather.\n",

      "Winter weather brings a unique set of challenges to vehicle operation. **Cold temperatures** can reduce battery capacity, thicken engine oil making it harder to start, and decrease tire pressure affecting handling and braking. **Snow** reduces traction, increases stopping distances, and can lead to vehicles getting stuck. **Ice** creates extremely hazardous driving conditions due to its slipperiness, drastically reducing grip. **Low visibility** from snow, fog, or shorter daylight hours limits drivers' reaction time and increases the risk of accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seasonal preparation is critical to mitigate these risks. Winter tires provide better grip on snow and ice. Checking and maintaining adequate antifreeze levels prevents engine damage. Ensuring the battery is in good condition avoids starting problems. Stocking an emergency kit with items like blankets, a flashlight, and jumper cables can be life-saving if stranded. Proactive preparation significantly enhances safety and vehicle reliability during the winter months, preventing costly repairs and potential accidents.\u001b[00m\n",

Winter tires provide better grip on snow and ice. Checking and maintaining adequate antifreeze levels prevents engine damage. Ensuring the battery is in good condition avoids starting problems.
