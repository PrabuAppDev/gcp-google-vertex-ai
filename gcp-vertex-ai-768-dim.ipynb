    "## Multi-Agent Orchestration: Acura MDX Winterization Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver winterization recommendations for the 2022 Acura MDX. It reindexes the owner's manual using 768-dimensional embeddings and orchestrates multiple AI agents to generate actionable outputs using Google Cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier attempts failed due to dimensionality mismatches:\n",
    "> Precondition failed: Query dimensionality (768) does not match database dimensionality (384)\n",
    "\n",
    "This version resolves that by:\n",
    "- Switching to the latest `text-embedding-005` model with 768-dimensional output\n",
    "- Creating a new Vertex AI Matching Engine index and endpoint in `us-central1`\n",
    "- Uploading correctly formatted JSON datapoints with `id`, `embedding`, and `content`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertex AI**: Hosts the vector index and serves queries via Matching Engine\n",
    "- **LlamaIndex**: Handles document chunking, embedding, and interfacing with the vector store\n",
    "- **Crew AI**: Provides multi-agent orchestration with role-based tasks\n",
    "- **Gemini LLMs**: Used for reasoning, summarization, and checklist generation through Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weather Agent**: Adds contextual seasonal hazards for winter\n",
    "- **Manual Review Agent**: Extracts vehicle-specific winterization steps from the owner's manual\n",
    "- **Recommendation Agent**: Compiles a structured winterization checklist in Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation serves as a reusable, extensible template for multi-agent RAG systems grounded in domain documents â€” integrating LLM reasoning with structured storage and enterprise-ready deployment.\n"

      "Winter weather presents numerous challenges to vehicle operation. Cold temperatures can reduce battery performance, thicken engine oil, and decrease tire pressure, leading to starting difficulties and reduced fuel efficiency. Snow and ice accumulation impair traction, increasing the risk of skidding and accidents. Low visibility due to snow, fog, or shorter daylight hours further complicates driving conditions.\n",

      "**Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **All-Wheel Drive (AWD):** The 2022 MDX comes standard with AWD, which provides better traction and stability in winter conditions.\n",
      "* **Heated seats:** The MDX has heated seats for both the front and rear passengers, which can help keep you warm on cold days.\n",
      "* **Heated steering wheel:** The MDX also has a heated steering wheel, which can be a welcome feature on cold mornings.\n",
      "* **Remote start:** The MDX has a remote start feature, which allows you to start the car and warm it up before you get in.\n",
      "* **Snow mode:** The MDX has a snow mode that adjusts the transmission and traction control settings for optimal performance in snowy conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Maintenance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Winter tires:** The manual recommends using winter tires if you live in an area with heavy snowfall. Winter tires have a special tread pattern that provides better grip on snow and ice.\n",
      "* **Tire chains:** The manual also recommends carrying tire chains in case you encounter severe winter conditions.\n",
      "* **Wiper blades:** The manual recommends replacing your wiper blades before winter starts. Worn wiper blades can't effectively clear snow and ice from your windshield.\n",
      "* **Battery:** The manual recommends having your battery checked before winter starts. Cold weather can shorten the life of a battery.\n",
      "* **Antifreeze:** The manual recommends checking your antifreeze level before winter starts. Antifreeze helps prevent your engine from freezing in cold weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Drive slowly and carefully in winter conditions.**\n",
