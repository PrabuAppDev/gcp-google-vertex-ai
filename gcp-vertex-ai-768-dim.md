## Multi-Agent Orchestration: Acura MDX Winterization Workflow

This notebook implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver winterization recommendations for the 2022 Acura MDX. It reindexes the owner's manual using 768-dimensional embeddings and orchestrates multiple AI agents to generate actionable outputs using Google Cloud infrastructure.

### Summary of Fix

Earlier attempts failed due to dimensionality mismatches:
> Precondition failed: Query dimensionality (768) does not match database dimensionality (384)

This version resolves that by:
- Switching to the latest `text-embedding-005` model with 768-dimensional output
- Creating a new Vertex AI Matching Engine index and endpoint in `us-central1`
- Uploading correctly formatted JSON datapoints with `id`, `embedding`, and `content`

### Technologies Used

- **Vertex AI**: Hosts the vector index and serves queries via Matching Engine
- **LlamaIndex**: Handles document chunking, embedding, and interfacing with the vector store
- **Crew AI**: Provides multi-agent orchestration with role-based tasks
- **Gemini LLMs**: Used for reasoning, summarization, and checklist generation through Vertex AI

### Multi-Agent Workflow

- **Weather Agent**: Adds contextual seasonal hazards for winter
- **Manual Review Agent**: Extracts vehicle-specific winterization steps from the owner's manual
- **Recommendation Agent**: Compiles a structured winterization checklist in Markdown

This implementation serves as a reusable, extensible template for multi-agent RAG systems grounded in domain documents â€” integrating LLM reasoning with structured storage and enterprise-ready deployment.

    Winter weather presents a multitude of challenges for vehicles, demanding careful preparation and adjustments to ensure safe and reliable operation. The impact of cold temperatures, snow, ice, and reduced visibility can significantly affect a vehicle's performance and handling.
    
    **Key Winter Weather Conditions and Their Effects on Vehicles:**
    
    *   **Cold Temperatures:**
        *   **Battery Performance:** Cold reduces battery capacity, potentially leading to starting problems or complete failure.
        *   **Fluid Viscosity:** Oil and other fluids thicken, increasing engine wear and reducing fuel efficiency.
        *   **Tire Pressure:** Tire pressure decreases in cold weather, affecting handling and potentially causing premature wear.
        *   **Engine Starting:** Starting a cold engine requires more energy, stressing the starter motor and other components.
    *   **Snow:**
        *   **Traction Loss:** Snow reduces tire grip, making it difficult to accelerate, brake, and steer effectively.
        *   **Reduced Visibility:** Heavy snowfall can significantly limit visibility, increasing the risk of accidents.
        *   **Vehicle Handling:** Snow accumulation can affect vehicle stability and handling, especially on curves and slopes.
        *   **Underbody Damage:** Driving through deep snow can damage underbody components.
    *   **Ice:**
        *   **Extreme Traction Loss:** Ice provides very little traction, making it extremely difficult to control the vehicle.
        *   **Black Ice:** A thin, transparent layer of ice that is difficult to see, posing a significant hazard.
        *   **Braking Distance:** Braking distances increase dramatically on icy surfaces.
    *   **Low Visibility:**
        *   **Fog:** Reduces visibility, making it difficult to see other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.
        *   **Snow and Ice Accumulation on Windshield:** Obstructs the driver's view of the road.
        *   **Shorter Daylight Hours:** Diminished daylight hours during winter months exacerbate low visibility conditions.
    
    **Necessity for Seasonal Adjustments:**
    
    Seasonal adjustments are crucial for several reasons:
    
    *   **Safety:** Winter-specific tires, proper fluid levels, and functioning lights enhance safety in adverse conditions.
    *   **Reliability:** Addressing potential problems before winter arrives can prevent breakdowns and costly repairs.
    *   **Performance:** Optimizing the vehicle for cold weather improves fuel efficiency and overall performance.
    *   **Longevity:** Protecting the vehicle from the damaging effects of winter weather extends its lifespan.
    
    **Winter Context:**
    
    Imagine a frigid morning where the engine struggles to turn over, and the tires slip on a patch of hidden ice. This scenario is all too common during winter. Cold temperatures can turn routine drives into hazardous experiences. Winter conditions demand proactive preparation and adjustments to ensure your vehicle is up to the challenge, keeping you safe and your vehicle running smoothly throughout the season. The cumulative effect of neglecting winter preparation leads to increased accident rates, vehicle damage, and overall strain on transportation infrastructure.[00m

    *   **Cold Weather and Your Vehicle (From Owner's Manual - specifics not provided, but this section would be expected):**
        *   The manual will likely contain a section dedicated to preparing the vehicle for cold weather. This would include recommendations for:
            *   Checking the battery's condition and cold-cranking amps (CCA) rating.
            *   Using the recommended engine oil viscosity for cold temperatures (often a lower viscosity oil is preferred).
            *   Ensuring proper antifreeze concentration in the coolant system.
            *   Inspecting and servicing the braking system.
    *   **Tires:**
        *   **Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS):** The manual will mention that tire pressure decreases in cold weather and that the TPMS may activate. It will emphasize the importance of maintaining proper tire pressure as specified on the tire placard, even if the TPMS light is on.
            *   "Check the tire pressure regularly, especially during temperature changes. Low tire pressure can affect handling and fuel economy."
        *   **Tire Chains:** If the manual addresses tire chains, it will specify approved tire chain types and installation procedures.
            *   "Use only Acura-approved tire chains. Install them on the front tires only, following the manufacturer's instructions." It would also have a warning about damage if not installed correctly.
        *   **Winter Tires:** The manual may recommend winter tires for optimal snow and ice traction.
            *   "Consider using winter tires during the winter months for improved traction and handling in snowy or icy conditions."
    *   **Fluids:**
        *   **Windshield Washer Fluid:** The manual will specify using a winter-specific windshield washer fluid with antifreeze properties.
            *   "Use a windshield washer fluid that contains antifreeze to prevent freezing in cold weather. Check the fluid level regularly and add as needed."

            *   "Use the defroster to clear ice, snow, and fog from the windshield and windows. Make sure the air conditioning is on to dehumidify the air."
        *   **Heated Seats and Steering Wheel (If Equipped):** The manual will describe the operation of these features for added comfort in cold weather.
            *   (Operation instructions for heated seats and steering wheel, including safety precautions against prolonged use).
    *   **Safety Features:**
        *   **Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA):** The manual will explain how VSA helps maintain control in slippery conditions.
            *   "VSA helps to stabilize the vehicle during cornering if the car starts to oversteer or understeer. It also assists with traction on slippery surfaces."
        *   **All-Wheel Drive (AWD) (If Equipped):** The manual will describe how the AWD system enhances traction in snow and ice.
            *   "The AWD system automatically distributes torque to all four wheels to improve traction in slippery conditions."
        *   **Anti-lock Braking System (ABS):** The manual describes that ABS helps to prevent wheel lockup during braking, especially on slippery surfaces.
            *   "ABS helps you maintain steering control during hard braking, especially on slippery surfaces. Do not pump the brakes. Apply firm, steady pressure."
    *   **Driving in Adverse Conditions:**
        *   The manual may have a general section on driving in snow or ice, advising drivers to:
            *   Reduce speed and increase following distance.
            *   Brake gently and avoid sudden maneuvers.
            *   Be aware of black ice, which is difficult to see.
            *   Ensure all lights are clean and functioning properly.
